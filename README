Basic notes on how to use packer and qemu to build a new image that gets
uploaded to AWS S3 and converted to an AMI to use in EC2.

# Run the packer build installation
sudo packer build --var-file=linux-ubuntu.pkrvars.hcl  ubuntu.pkr.hcl

# To view the details of the image that was created in the previous step: 
qemu-img info <imageName>

# Run this command to convert QCOW2 to RAW format
qemu-img convert <imageDirectoryLocation>/<nameOfImage> <imageDirectoryLocation>/<nameOfImage>.raw

# In order to copy RAW file to AWS: Install and configure 'awscli' with AWS credentials
# If you do not have 'awscli' installed you can get it from: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

# Test AWS credentials by running the following command: 
aws s3 ls

# If you need to create a new bucket if needed in the AWS region you're using:
aws s3 mb s3://<nameOfBucket>

# Run this command to upload the converted image to the S3 bucket:
aws s3 cp <imageDirectoryLocation>/<nameOfImage>.raw s3://<nameOfBucket>

# In order to import the RAW image into AWS for use.  You must have a file that contains details about the RAW image to be imported.
#   The file can be named anything, but should contain the information listed below and have the json extension: <nameOfFile>.json
[
  {
    "Description": "<detailedDescriptionOfImage>",
    "Format": "raw",
    "UserBucket": {
      "S3Bucket": "<nameOfBucket>",
      "S3Key": "<nameOfImage>.raw"
    }
  }
]

# Import the image to a new AMI
aws ec2 import-image --description "<detailedDescriptionOfImage>" --architecture x86_64 --platform Linux --disk-containers file://<nameOfFile>.json

# In order to watch the conversion/import process you can run the following command.
watch -n 1 aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --region <regionWhereS3BucketExists>

# Once the import process has completed you should now see an AMI to be used for AWS EC2 Instances
