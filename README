Basic notes on how to use packer and qemu to build a new image that gets
uploaded to AWS S3 and converted to an AMI to use in EC2.

This should be expanded on to work with Azure, GCE, and VMWare as well.
We should use Jenkins so that rebuilding the base image should cause any
images that use the base to get automatically rebuilt.

!!!NOTE ABOUT THE PACKER INSTALL!!!
During the install, DO NOT do anything at the boot menu. After approximately
10 seconds, Packer will choose the appropriate boot entry and add any kernel
arguments that are needed. If you need to add more yourself, alter the JSON
file that you told Packer to use.

# Set up packer directory
mkdir -p ~/packer/linux/centos/7
cd ~/packer/linux/centos/7

# Edit centos7-manual.json file for manual install if needed.
# This is a good step to use to make sure the environment is set up correctly
# for qemu builds.
vim centos7-manual.json

# Run the manual install
packer build centos7-manual.json

# OPTIONAL: Run qemu on the image with the drives on nvme devices
# Best to do this on a home machine since it uses VNC.
# If you do this on an ONBMC machine, add "-display none"
qemu-x86_64 -writeconfig qemu.config -cpu host -smp 2 -m 4096M \
  -accel kvm,thread=multi -device nvme,drive=drive0,serial=foo \
  -drive if=none,file=output_centos_76_base/centos-7.6-base,id=drive0,cache=writeback,discard=ignore,format=qcow2

# Once the manual install has finished, remove the output directory
rm -rf output*

# Once the manual install is working, edit the kickstart file if necessary.
# This shouldn't be needed often, if at all.
vim kickstart/ks.cfg

# Kick off the automated build
packer build centos7-kickstart.json 

# Skip this if you aren't interested in details about the qcow2 image
qemu-img info centos-7.6-base 

# Convert QCOW2 to RAW format
qemu-img convert output/centos-7.6-base output/centos-7.6-base.raw

# Install and configure awscli if needed
mkdir ~/.aws
aws configure

# Make sure AWS credentials work.
aws s3 ls

# Create new bucket if needed in the region.
# This shouldn't be needed.
aws s3 mb s3://packer-linux-images

# Upload the converted image to S3
aws s3 cp output/centos-7.6-base.raw s3://packer-linux-images

# Edit container.json as necessary
# Again, shouldn't be necessary.
vim container.json

# Import the image to a new AMI
aws ec2 import-image --description "CentOS 7.6 Base Image" --architecture x86_64 --platform Linux --disk-containers file://containers.json

# Watch the conversion/import process.
# Update us-west-2 with whatever region you used.
# Shouldn't need to use a different region, we can copy from this region to
# different ones as needed. Automatically, even.
watch -n 1 aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --region us-west-2

# Conversion/import is completed at this point, or errored.
# If completed, launch a new instance with the new AMI to test.
# This should be automated, but isn't yet.
